Hi, I am Nusayer. I am a CS graduate from [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/). I have a huge passion for web/mobile app development. During my undergraduate years, I have done several java and flutter projects. I am also passionate about deep learning and machine learning. My undergraduate research work was about predicting seizures in epileptic patients, which was published at [IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230899) conference.
